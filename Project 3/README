Description: I have created a custom string class 'aString' with appropriate
data members, constructors and destructors. Same for the 'Node' Class. My
BST class has utility functions along with the appropriate constructors and destructors.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program Flow: There are two objects S1 and S2 with are BST pointers and the interactive
user will execute the commands on them. A BST root pointer gets created which is a pointer
to aString. So, BST Node will have 3 attributes, a data field which is aString pointer and
two Node pointers left and right.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assumptions: The interactive user enters valid data.
